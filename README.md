# CS-305

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

<-Artemis Fiancial is a company that wants to modernize its operations and increase security for its client data. Most of the project is protection of data transfer, for this the use of ciphers, alogrthms, and checksums where used.->


What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

<-Learning to do manual code review can be a huge step in catching a lot of early on errors. In the code files we can see that naming convention of classes allow is an issue. Doing regular code review can not only catch mistakes and errors but will help code quaility was well.-> 

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

<-Figuring out false postives was a real challange, but the rescearch was super helpful in understanding why the false postives show up and how they can seem overwhelming at first.->

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?


How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?


What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

<-I think the use of algorithms and checksum verifcation will be extremely usful in the future. I also think that the dependancy checks, and being able to determine false postives will help keep future code safe and secure.->

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
